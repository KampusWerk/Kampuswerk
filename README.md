# Kampuswerk (Development)

This is a Flask web application for conducting and logging your Rock Climbing Training sessions 

Provides a way to lo interactive record your Hangboarding, track your Campus Boarding and aid general rock climbing workouts like circuits, 
Routes and Bouldering

I've hosted the main application here : www.kampuswerk.com (uses Ouath2 for login/account creation, so you can keep and export your data) 

To clone and run locally you will need to create a virtualenv, install dependencies from the requirements.txt file and config.py file 

Message me for any more info!
